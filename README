NOTE: BUILDS BUT NEVER TESTED YET.
I will acquire the RTC next week to finish debug!

==============================================================

This is an Arduino IDE compatible SPI driver for the NXP
Semiconductors PCF2123 real-time clock.

PCF2123 is an "ultra" low-power (sub-uA) RTC that supports a
number of alarm features, as well as square wave clock signal
output.

This library provides access to nearly all of the RTC's
features.

This library depends on the LGPL-licensed Time library

Datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCF2123.pdf

If you are planning to call PCF2123 from an interrupt handler,
remember to register your interrupt with SPI.usingInterrupt().

PCF2123 supports tying MOSI and MISO together. This is
supported in theory, by always writing zeroes when reading
from slave. Then it's probably enough to connect a diode
between controller MOSI and slave's MOSI+MISO to have this
mode supported, but this has not been tested.
