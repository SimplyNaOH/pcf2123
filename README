This is an Arduino IDE compatible driver for the NXP
Semiconductors PCF2123 real-time clock.

PCF2123 is a low-power (sub-uA) RTC that supports a number
of alarm features, as well as square wave clock signal
output.

I wrote this because it was not possible to find a
compatible RTC library that would directly support the
PCF2123, especially with the alarm and signal generator
features.
